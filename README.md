# micropoly

A very simple, very WIP note management app.

## Run it

- Have PHP 7.4 with SQLite installed
- Run `composer install`
- Run the PHP development server like this `php -S localhost:8080 index.php`

You can probably also run it on Apache or nginx+php-fpm but it's not yet tested.
Also there is no user management yet, so it's not probably not wise to run it on a proper, public-facing webserver...

## Documentation

None (yet?). You're on your own. Good luck!
